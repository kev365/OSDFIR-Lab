# OSDFIR Lab Configs Directory Reorganization

## Project Overview
Reorganize the OSDFIR Lab project structure by moving the `helm/configs` directory to the project root as `configs/` for better accessibility and organization.

## Current State
- Configuration files are located in `helm/configs/`
- Contains two subdirectories: `helm/configs/data/` and main config file `helm/configs/osdfir-lab-values.yaml`
- Referenced in `terraform/main.tf` for deployment configuration

## Goals
1. Move `helm/configs` to project root as `configs/`
2. Update all path references in codebase
3. Maintain all functionality and file integrity
4. Improve project organization and accessibility

## Requirements
- Preserve all configuration files and directory structure
- Update Terraform path references
- Test deployment to ensure functionality is maintained
- Commit changes to git properly

## Files to Update
- `terraform/main.tf` - Update 3 path references
- Move directory structure from `helm/configs/` to `configs/`

## Success Criteria
- All config files successfully moved to new location
- Terraform deployment works without errors
- All path references updated correctly
- No loss of configuration data
